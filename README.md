# Food_Predictor

## Purpose

The goal of the project is to create a site that will allow us to gather all of the pertinent health data then use that data to draw correlations to find what might be causing pain flare ups in people with certain auto-immune diseases.

The data we will be gathering includes:
1. Pain Level
2. Pain Type
3. Pain Location
4. Food eaten
5. Medications
6. Supplements
7. Activities
8. Mood
9. Menstrual Cycle
10. Current diagnosis

Others can be added as needed.

Each user will have a login and only have access to their data but the admin will be able to create correlation matrices using all user data to try and find if there are any overarching correlations. These can be pulled for all matching diagnoses.
